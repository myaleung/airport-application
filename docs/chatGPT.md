# Additional Requirements
## Stormy Weather

ChatGPT Log: https://chat.openai.com/share/04c29422-3e54-4f28-a810-260543ef304a

I asked Chat GPT for some test ideas for stormy weather conditions in my program to see if I've covered all grounds of testing.<br>

ChatGPT responded with a list of tests in a behavior-driven style using RSpec syntax which seemed similar to the tests I've written for my user stories.<br><br>

Using the above, I checked to see if my original test cases were adequate and if I missed any test cases from my user stories and wrote the test and code for the TDD of the additional requirements.

I then enquired about some edge cases I may not that thought off during the creation and test phases of my process for the stormy weather conditions which has helped me understand some of the potential risks this software may have.<br><br>
