# Airport Software
## The Software
The software is to help solve the traffic flow of the Digital Futures Airport and aid traffic controllers to know when to land a plane or release a plane for take off. The software would also know if a plane is currently at the airport.

## Benefits
The benefits this software will provide include,
* Helping traffic controllers instruct a plane for takeoff and landing - This is so duplicate planes are not landed at the airport and planes that don't exist are asked to take off.
* Controlling the airport traffic flow and keeping capacity at a limit - Therefore the capacity of the airport doesn't overflow and can expand where valid
* Knowing how many planes are at the airport and if the capacity is at maximum - So traffic controllers know when not to land planes
